# tetris

Tetris coded with HTML5 and Javascript / jQuery using <canvas>.

## Steps finished.

* Added a grid method : drawing a tetromino square on the grid.
* Added a grid method : generate new tetromino.
* Added a grid method to make fall the active tetromino.
* Added a grid method to generate a new tetromino when the active tetromino cannot fall no more.
* If a new tetromino cannot be generated because the space is already occupied, game is over.
* We can now move the tetromino to the left or right.
* We can now accelerate the tetromino's fall by pressing the down arrow key.
